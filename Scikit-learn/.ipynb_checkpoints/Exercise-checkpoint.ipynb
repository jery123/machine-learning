    "But when it comes to classification, you'll likely want to use a few more evaluation metrics, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Confusion matrix - Compares the predicted values with the true values in a tabular way, if 100% correct, all values in the matrix will be top left to bottom right (diagnol line).\n",
    "    * Cross-validation - Splits your dataset into multiple parts and train and tests your model on each part and evaluates performance as an average.\n",
    "    * Precision - Proportion of true positives over total number of samples. Higher precision leads to less false positives.\n",
    "    * Recall - Proportion of true positives over total number of true positives and false positives. Higher recall leads to less false negatives.\n",
    "    * F1 score - Combines precision and recall into one metric. 1 is best, 0 is worst.\n",
    "    * Classification report - Sklearn has a built-in function called classification_report() which returns some of the main classification metrics such as precision, recall and f1-score.\n",
    "    * ROC Curve - Receiver Operating Characterisitc is a plot of true positive rate versus false positive rate.\n",
    "    * Area Under Curve (AUC) - The area underneath the ROC curve. A perfect model achieves a score of 1.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get to these, we'll instantiate a new instance of our model using the best hyerparameters found by RandomizedSearchCV.\n"

    "Challenge: Write down what each of the columns in this classification report are.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Precision - Indicates the proportion of positive identifications (model predicted class 1) which were actually correct. A model which produces no false positives has a precision of 1.0.\n",
    "    * Recall - Indicates the proportion of actual positives which were correctly classified. A model which produces no false negatives has a recall of 1.0.\n",
    "    * F1 score - A combination of precision and recall. A perfect model achieves an F1 score of 1.0.\n",
    "    * Support - The number of samples each metric was calculated on.\n",
    "    * Accuracy - The accuracy of the model in decimal form. Perfect accuracy is equal to 1.0.\n",
    "    * Macro avg - Short for macro average, the average precision, recall and F1 score between classes. Macro avg doesn’t class imbalance into effort, so if you do have class imbalances, pay attention to this metric.\n",
    "    * Weighted avg - Short for weighted average, the weighted average precision, recall and F1 score between classes. Weighted means each metric is calculated with respect to how many samples there are in each class. This metric will favour the majority class (e.g. will give a high value when one class out performs another due to having more samples).\n",
    "\n",
    "The classification report gives us a range of values for precision, recall and F1 score, time to find these metrics using Scikit-Learn functions.\n"
